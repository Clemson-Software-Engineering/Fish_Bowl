# Fish_Bowl

This project is being undertaken by a student to create an online version of the party game "Fish Bowl." Because this project is a part of coursework, it is not current accepting outside contributions.

The current state of the project is a functional HTML version of the game which can be run locally. This at least saves paper, but is limitted.
